# Bad-Debt-Prediction
Task: To analyze the given data and make a classification model so as to predict whether an account is going to become a bad debt or not.

Context: Real Estate Sector is quite random and in the past has been susceptible to a downturn in the times of economic crisis. Whenever the economy suffers, bad debts and stressed assets can become a huge problem for real estate financing companies. Timely analysis of these accounts (that are unable to pay the due amount) can help the firms to forecast the number of such accounts and help them mitigate the losses.

Steps followed: Made a Logistic Regression Model to classify Bad debt accounts on the basis of historic data using Python3 on Jupyter notebook.

This notebook was used in an online hackathon and obtained Mean Precision Score = 0.9815

Note: The data used here contains dummy values and shouldnâ€™t be correlated to real world!
